# LLM Interpretability: Zero-Shot vs. Fine-Tuned Comparison

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive framework for comparing the interpretability of large language models (LLMs) across zero-shot and task-specific fine-tuned configurations. Using the Llama 3.2 1B model, we perform token-level attributional analysis through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and provide extensive evaluation metrics including model performance and interpretability statistics.

The implementation is designed to be accessible and reproducible, with Colab-optimized code that can be executed on free-tier GPU resources.

## Key Features

- **Binary Classification Experiments**: Token-level interpretability analysis on the The Stanford Sentiment Treebank (https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/sst2)
- **Dual-Path Evaluation**: Direct comparison of zero-shot model behavior versus LoRA-adapted fine-tuned variants
- **SHAP-Based Attribution**: Token-level explanation extraction with statistical aggregation
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1), interpretability metrics (sparsity, entropy, agreement), and effect size analysis
- **LoRA Adapter Support**: Lightweight fine-tuning with persistent adapter storage

## Interpretability Methods

This implementation references three major approaches for model explanation:

- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**: A perturbation-based technique that trains local surrogate models to identify feature importance. While model-agnostic and easy to apply to text, it can be sensitive to sampling strategies.

- **KernelSHAP**: Approximates Shapley values using a weighted kernel that emphasizes coalitions near the original input. It inherits desirable properties (local accuracy, missingness, consistency) while remaining practical for deep networks through sampling.
  
- **ROAR (Remove And Retrain)**: A direct faithfulness evaluation method that measures how much model accuracy drops when top-ranked features are iteratively removed and the model is retrained. While computationally expensive for large models, ROAR provides a strong empirical measure of explanation fidelity.

For classification evaluation, we complement accuracy-based metrics with the **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**, which provides a balanced score (−1 to +1) that remains informative under class imbalance. An MCC of +1 indicates perfect predictions, 0 matches random guessing, and −1 reflects complete disagreement.


Methodology: Computed vs. Static Properties
The evaluation of XAI properties (F1–F11) in llama_3.2_1B_xai_2.py and llama_3.2_1B_roar.py utilizes a hybrid approach. While properties dependent on the data distribution are calculated at runtime, properties inherent to the algorithmic design of LIME/SHAP or those requiring prohibitive computational resources are assigned static values based on established literature.

Dynamically Computed Properties

These scores are calculated during execution based on the specific Llama-3.2-1B model and SST-2 dataset: F1.1 Scope: Measures the diversity of features selected across the evaluation set. F1.4 Practicality: Calculated as the average of F11 (Speed) and F1.3 (Access). F3 Selectivity: Measures feature selectivity using Gini coefficient based on LIME/SHAP weights. F4.1 Contrastivity: Measures whether explanations contain both positive and negative contributions. F4.2 Target Sensitivity: Measures divergence in LIME explanations between opposite class labels. F6.1 Fidelity Check: Measures how well LIME/SHAP approximations match the model's predicted probabilities (scaled 0-5). F6.2 Surrogate Agreement: Measures fidelity on the original scale (0-1) for the local linear approximation. F7.1 Incremental Deletion: Measures prediction drop when top features are iteratively masked from the input. F9.1 Similarity (Stability): Measures consistency of explanations under input perturbations. F9.2 Identity: Measures consistency of feature rankings across multiple explanation runs. F11 Speed: Measures execution time per explanation (scaled to 1-5).

```

   
## Output Artifacts

The pipeline generates the following outputs in the specified `--output-dir`:

### Model Artifacts
- **`lora_adapter/`**: Trained LoRA adapter weights for reuse via `PeftModel.from_pretrained()`

## Configuration Options

### Model Selection
- `--model-name` (default: `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B`): Model checkpoint to use. Swap to an open-access alternative if preferred.

### Data Configuration
- `--train-subset` (default: 2000): Number of training examples to sample
- `--eval-subset` (default: 1000): Number of evaluation examples to sample
- `--train-split` (default: `train`): Training data split name
- `--eval-split` (default: `test`): Evaluation data split name
- `--text-field` (default: `text`): Column name for input text
- `--label-field` (default: `label`): Column name for labels
- `--label-space`: Explicitly specify numeric labels to include (e.g., to exclude neutral class)

### Experiment Options
- `--finetune`: Enable LoRA fine-tuning on the training subset
- `--run-shap`: Extract SHAP attributions (disable with `--no-run-shap` for faster runs)
- `--load-in-4bit` (default: True): Use 4-bit quantization. Disable with `--no-load-in-4bit` for full precision on high-memory GPUs
- `--output-dir`: Directory for output artifacts
- `--huggingface-token`: Hugging Face authentication token for gated models

## Notes

- **Model Access**: The default Llama 3.2 1B model is gated. [Request access](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B) and authenticate via token before running.
- **Memory Efficiency**: By default, we sample 2,000 training and 1,000 evaluation examples to maintain Colab compatibility. Adjust `--train-subset` and `--eval-subset` as needed, or set to `None` for the full dataset.
- **Fine-Tuning Details**: During fine-tuning, instruction tokens are masked with `-100` so the loss only supervises the appended label token, keeping LoRA updates focused on classification decisions.
- **Output Visualization**: Charts render inline in Colab notebooks when available; otherwise they are saved as PNG files.

```

### Transferring Results

Transfer results from PACE to local machine:
```bash
scp -r <gt_username>@ice.cc.gatech.edu:/home/<gt_username>/llm_interpretability/outputs/pace_xai_analysis ./results_from_pace/
```

### PACE-Specific Considerations

- **GPU Allocation**: Request appropriate GPU resources (A100 for larger models, V100/H100 for standard tasks)
- **Memory Management**: Monitor memory usage with `nvidia-smi` in interactive sessions
- **Job Time Limits**: Default partition has 4-hour limit; longer jobs may need `--partition=gpu-long` (up to 24 hours)
- **Storage**: Store large datasets in `/scratch` directory for faster I/O; results in `$HOME` are automatically backed up
- **Data Transfer**: For large models/datasets, use `rsync` or `globus` instead of `scp` for improved performance

### Example: Interactive GPU Session

For development and debugging:
```bash
interactive -p gpu -N 1 --gres=gpu:A100:1 -c 8 --mem=64G -t 120
```

Then run the script directly:
```bash
python llama_3.2_1B_xai.py --model-name meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B --output-dir outputs/debug_run --train-size 100 --eval-sample-size 10
```

### Troubleshooting on PACE

- **CUDA out of memory**: Reduce `--train-size` or `--eval-sample-size`, or enable `--load-in-4bit`
- **Module not found**: Verify all modules are loaded and environment is activated
- **Slow I/O**: Use `/scratch` for intermediate files instead of `$HOME`
- **Job timeout**: Increase `--time` in SLURM header or reduce model size/data volume
